Ludum dare 45 ideas
-------------------

Theme: Start with nothing.

Implies there is somthing to gain.
Can be anything assuming you gather somthing eg. skills, items, gold.

Building management game such as Theme hospital. -- Will have a very limited scope.
	- Mini metro like!
		- blank screen.
		- stations are slowly added at random locations.
		- simple graphics. top down 2d.
		- Customisable / upgradable trains.
		- Tile based!

Stealth game you have to get the most gold? RNG time limted map.
World is empty you have have to discover it somehow.
